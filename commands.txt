1. Temporarily Change the Execution Policy for the Current Session:
You can allow scripts to run in the current PowerShell session with the following command:

powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
Then, you should be able to activate the virtual environment:

powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
This change will only apply to the current session. If you close and reopen PowerShell, you'll need to run the Set-ExecutionPolicy command again.
